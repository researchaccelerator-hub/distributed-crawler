# Distributed Crawler

A powerful, scalable Go-based application designed to scrape messages and metadata from multiple social media platforms. Built with a **modular, pluggable architecture** that makes it easy to extend with new data sources while maintaining consistent output formats for seamless data pipeline integration.

## Key Features

<div class="features-grid">
  {% for feature in site.features %}
  <div class="feature-card">
    <div class="feature-icon">{{ feature.icon }}</div>
    <h3>{{ feature.title }}</h3>
    <p>{{ feature.description }}</p>
  </div>
  {% endfor %}
</div>

## Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/researchaccelerator-hub/distributed-crawler.git
cd distributed-crawler

# Build the application
go build -o distributed-crawler

# Run with basic configuration
./distributed-crawler --urls "channel1,channel2,channel3"
```

## Supported Platforms

### Telegram
- Scrape messages, media, and metadata from public channels
- Support for text, images, videos, and documents
- Capture engagement metrics (views, reactions, comments)
- Handle rate limiting and authentication automatically

### YouTube
- Extract video metadata and comments
- Support for channel URLs, handles, and IDs
- Comprehensive engagement data (views, likes, comments)
- Efficient API quota management

## Modular & Extensible Architecture

Built in **Go** for performance and portability, the Distributed Crawler features a pluggable architecture that makes it easy to add new platforms and data sources:

### üîå Pluggable Platform Support
- **Interface-based design** allows adding new platforms without core changes
- **Unified data models** ensure consistent output across all platforms
- **Platform-specific adapters** handle API differences and rate limiting
- **Currently supports**: Telegram, YouTube (more platforms coming soon)

### üöÄ Go-Powered Performance
- **Cross-platform binaries** - runs on Linux, macOS, Windows, and ARM
- **Low memory footprint** and efficient concurrent processing
- **Single executable** with no runtime dependencies
- **Fast compilation** and easy deployment

### üìä Data Pipeline Ready
- **Standardized JSONL output** works with any data processing system
- **Consistent schema** across all platforms simplifies analysis
- **Incremental processing** with progress tracking and resumability
- **Multiple storage backends** (local files, cloud storage, databases)

## Execution Modes

Choose the deployment model that fits your scale:

- **Standalone Mode**: Simple single-process execution for small jobs
- **Distributed Mode**: Orchestrator + worker architecture for large-scale operations
- **DAPR Integration**: Cloud-native deployment with state management and observability

## Why Choose Distributed Crawler?

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer-Friendly
- **Single binary deployment** - no complex installations or dependencies
- **Clear CLI interface** with comprehensive help and examples
- **Extensive configuration options** via command line, files, or environment variables
- **Detailed logging and monitoring** for troubleshooting and optimization

### üîß Production-Ready
- **Graceful error handling** with automatic retries and backoff
- **Progress tracking** with resumable crawls and checkpoint saving
- **Resource management** with configurable concurrency and rate limiting
- **Cloud-native support** with DAPR integration and distributed architectures

### üìà Scalable by Design
- **Horizontal scaling** with orchestrator/worker pattern
- **Efficient resource usage** with Go's lightweight concurrency model
- **Platform-agnostic deployment** on containers, VMs, or bare metal
- **State management** options for both local and distributed scenarios

## Use Cases

- **Academic Research**: Collect data for social media analysis
- **Content Analysis**: Track engagement patterns and trends
- **Market Research**: Monitor brand mentions and sentiment
- **Data Journalism**: Gather evidence for investigative reporting

## Unified Data Output

All platforms output data in a **consistent JSONL format**, making it easy to build data pipelines and analytics workflows:

```json
{
  "post_uid": "12345-channel",
  "url": "https://t.me/channel/12345",
  "channel_name": "Example Channel",
  "published_at": "2023-04-01T12:34:56Z",
  "description": "Message content",
  "views_count": 1000,
  "engagement": 1075,
  "platform_name": "Telegram",
  "comments": [...],
  "channel_data": {...}
}
```

### Pipeline Integration Benefits
- **Same schema** whether scraping Telegram, YouTube, or future platforms
- **Direct ingestion** into data lakes, warehouses, and analytics tools
- **Stream processing ready** with line-by-line JSONL format
- **Metadata rich** with engagement metrics, timestamps, and platform context
